# Loan-Status-Prediction
The project aims to predict loan status using classification models. Four different models are utilized for this purpose: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), XGBoost Classifier, and K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier (KNN). The objective is to build models that can effectively classify loan applications into approved or not approved categories based on various features and attributes. These models are trained using historical loan data, with known loan statuses, to learn patterns and make predictions on new, unseen loan applications. The performance and accuracy of each model are evaluated to determine the most effective approach for loan status prediction.
